## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - For Styles

### What I learned

I learned to use the CSS Grid Layout with Tailwind in this project, though it's still a very challenging part of CSS for me, I plan to get better with it in vanilla css and in Tailwind especially.

### Continued development

I will continue to read the docs and improve my tailwind skills. I have really gained interest in tailwind css at this point so that's now a priority.

### Useful resources

- [Official tailwind Docs for sure](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
